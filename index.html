Project:  Project1 Title Page
Name: Emerson Smith
Submitted: 8/26/2023
 
I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.

Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  This project taught me how  to create a proper title page for a website. I learned how to run my code properly and through trial and error
 I was able to create a project worth something looking at.

    <h2>The Antisocial Cat</h2>
        <p> In response to my speedy cat who refuses to hangout with me:</p>
        <p> Runs away from me,</p>
        <p> Too fast for me to catch him,</p>
        <p> I need a new cat. </p>
    
    <h2>My personal interests</h2>
        <p> A game I fell in love with and can talk about for hours is called Tales of Symphonia. This game is a foundation of my childhood and a big part of why my brothers and I are still as close as we've always been. The story is incredible and everytime I play it I learn something new about it.</p>
        <p> I'm a big animal guy. I love every animal that is capable of loving me back and even those who are incapable(minus snakes). I spend a lot of my days hanging out with my dogs and just giving them all the love I can. Animals deserve the world.</p>
        <p> Something else I love talking about are my friends. They are like family to me and I will do anything I can to help them out of a tough spot. I play video games almost every night with my friends and we talk about anything and everything. They've helped me through some tough times as well.</p>
